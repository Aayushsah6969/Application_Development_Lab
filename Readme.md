# Application Development Lab

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **Application Development Lab**, where we explore both **supervised** and **unsupervised machine learning algorithms**, perform data analysis, build tools, and develop end-to-end applications using Python.

## 📌 Overview

Throughout this lab, the focus is on understanding and implementing core concepts in machine learning and application development. Key components include:

* Implementing **supervised learning algorithms** such as regression, classification, and ensemble models.
* Exploring **unsupervised learning techniques** like clustering and dimensionality reduction.
* Conducting in-depth **data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis**.
* Building **ML-powered tools** for automation, prediction, and data insights.
* Using **Python** for full-stack application development, covering:

  * Frontend interfaces (simple UIs or web frameworks)
  * Backend systems (API creation, database interactions, ML model deployment)

## 🧪 Lab Activities

* Hands-on coding exercises for various ML algorithms.
* Mini-projects to understand real-world workflows.
* Experiments with datasets for pattern recognition and model evaluation.
* Building utilities that integrate ML models with user-facing features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (Primary programming language)
* **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data analysis & visualization
* **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
* **Flask / FastAPI / Django** for backend development (as applicable)
* **HTML / CSS / JS** or Python frameworks for frontend interfaces

## 🚀 Final Project

At the end of the lab, a full application will be developed that combines:

* Data preprocessing
* ML model training and evaluation
* A functional frontend
* A backend capable of handling requests and serving intelligent responses
